            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
           <P>WARTHOG
               <P>Phacochoerus is a genus of wild pigs in the family Suidae, known as warthogs.</P> It is the sole genus of subfamily Phacochoerinae. <P>They are found in open and semiopen habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa.</P> <P>The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog) is Phacochoerus africanus.</P>


<P>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?

You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.</P>
